====== high level design ======
Created Saturday 25 January 2020

ask for fr( functional req)
- ask users of system admin, seller, buyer, analysts etc
ask for nfr
- avail 99.9, eventual consistency, push to user, latency percentile, 
scope closure by must, good to have
separate write( sync/async), read paths
**take time to think** and create diagrams
- find out actors and services( common ones like user, notif, search, inventory, catalogue or productlisting, productdetail, )
- identify user journey/flows and link them to services
quantization
- based on numbers choose and add datastores to services
- based on numbers add linking between services and choose method of comm. direct call vs queue based vs orchestration vs choreography 

follow PASSMECD( perf, availability, scalability, security, maintainability, extensability, cost, disaster recovery)
evolve system to microservices
discuss resource crunch
- CPU/memory/network
discuss failure scenarios
- application /service level
- datacenter level / network partitioning
- disaster recovery
discuss breakup of services into microservices
discuss testing
- use chaos engineering for resiliency
discuss optimizations
- mention geographically distributed mysql with master slave for read write split
discuss operational excellence & security
- logging, monitoring, alerting
- security testing, ddos attacks

choice of datastore based on scale, structure of data

give back open source/ cloud specific solutions  like hadoop / s3, kafka/sqs
some cases active user count plays important role to optimise index sizes
for celebrity users precompute feed for the followers, as runtime IO will be large



terms:
streaming rpc, query engine, multiparser, rate limiter, handler, ingestor, 
service names: 
user, catalogue, inventory, item, search, purchase, pricing, warehouse, logistics, notification, analytics, recommendation, archival, tracking, 
boxes over services: Order processing system, inventory management system
