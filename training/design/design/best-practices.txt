micro service arch deosn't mean each team should use its own language/framework
k8s based microservices is better than netflix oss( bound to java only)
API first approach to first define schema and then generate code them. helpful in case of change of language. implement methods later on
try to generate/consume events with defined structure rather than each service call ton of services
don't let other service connect directly to db. it makes schema change harder
database, domain endpoint naming should be consistent
Using API first approach check if index is on the column => it should be automated while creating api
generate mock clients to write simple tests
standard health check for all applications
schemas of all events should be defined before hand in binary. binary schema forces dev to generate code and breakings are recognised at compile time
producers gaurantee at least once delivery: store data in journal table so that repush can happen on failuer
consumers should gaurantee idempotency
journal database is partitioned daily say for 3 days, on fourth day first partition is dropped
