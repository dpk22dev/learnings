In music, tones which have frequencies which are a power of two apart are considered to be the same note in different octaves.

Each octave is split into 12 notes which are geometrically spaced within the octave. Given a musical note of frequency f, the frequency of the nth note above f is given by:
f * 2 ^ ( n/12)
