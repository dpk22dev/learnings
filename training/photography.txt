whitebalance: should not use auto white balance
< 4000k bluish light
> 7000k yellowish light

**exposure triangle parameters:**
1) shutter speed: duration of time shutter is open
low shutter speed: motion/hand blur -> silky flow of water
highter shuter speed: freezes action -> granular image of water
no effect on landscape/standing image
camera will open for this much amount of time; high value means more duration for which light is coming => bright picture

2) aperture: how large opening of lens is -> controls amount of light comming into camera
f20: large aperture -> very small opening -> large area of image is in sharp focus/depth of image is large	
f4: small aperture -> very large opening
it controls depth of field: area of photograph that is in sharp focus
tip: single subject low f value with work, but more subjects and want all of them to be in sharp focus -> use high f value

3) ISO: how fast sensor can react to light
low iso means low light use in day time, high iso is overkill, bright picture: use in dark env
earlier analog cameras film had chemicals to react to light
high ISO -> high noise -> grains in image
as ISO gets lower, camera gets less sensitive
keep a tap on ISO, very high iso will make noisy image

**modes:**
1) TV/Yes mode/shutter priority mode
set shutter priority, camera will blink aperture and set suitable value
2) AV/aperture priority mode
for given aperture value, camera decides shutter speed
recommended when not much movement happening in scene eg landscape mode
3) Manual mode
4) portrait mode: more emphasis on shallow depth of field
5) close-up mode: more emphasis on shallow depth of field
6) landscape mode: camera gives emphasis on larges depth of field to give everything in focus
7) sports/action: camera gives faster shutter speed
8) night mode: long exposure

**focusing modes and focusing points:**
one shot focus/auto focus single: lock focus on static subject
AI servo/auto focus continous: camera continously focus even when subject is moving
AI focus/ auto focus auto: mixture of above two, car race, wildlife photogrpahy

avoid enable all focus points, use one of focus points. camera autofocus

**metering**
based on amount on light reflecting from subject, camera will decide shutter speed. this is metering.
**spot metering**: based on focus point, camera will give decent shutter speed. exposure compensation can be changed to go into darker/brigther value
AEB: auto exposure bracketing
**evaluative metering/matrix/multi segment metering: **average of whole scene 
partial metering: central point takes 12-30% around center, while spot takes 2-3%
center-weighted-average metering: 

if you want to keep dark tonality, under expose image; if want bright tonality over expose image

**Composition**
rule of thirds: put object in intersection of 3x3 grid
centered: blance left/right or up/down part of image
leading lines: straight/ curved lines
add foreground -> mid ground -> end ground
use focal length wisely
aperture: background is not interesting(separate background from subject) use high aperture eg: f2.8
to include background use smaller aperture f8-f14

**post processing:**
tools: adobe bridge, 
different tools can show same raw file in different way


todo:
after 34

questions:
how shutter works, how shutter speed effects it
