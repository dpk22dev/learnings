====== machine learning and AI ======
Created Wednesday 09 March 2016

The systems which exhibit intelligent behavior, learn, demonstrate, explain, and advice its users.
perception, reasoning, problem solving, learning, linguistic intelligence

Usage: Gaming, Natural language processing, Expert systems, speech recognition, handwriting recognition, intelligent robots

 Initially AI problems, including Image Understanding (a really hard one), Signal Processing, Voice Understanding, and Text Understanding, were done by advanced algorithm and coding techniques.
But machine learning is real AI enabling computer with generic understanding. Machine learning create intelligent systems is to have the system itself create and maintain its own World Models. Continuously, in response to sensory input.

eg: in chess checking 10 steps ahead moves is not AI really. system has to learn from inputs what will be most probable step of user this time.

**Intelligence:** The ability of a system to calculate, reason, perceive relationships and analogies, learn from experience, store and retrieve information from memory, solve problems, comprehend complex ideas, use natural language fluently, classify, generalize, and adapt new situations.

intelligence can be:
Linguistic intelligence, Musical intelligence, Logical-mathematical intelligence, Spatial intelligence, Bodily-Kinesthetic intelligence, Intra-personal intelligence, Interpersonal intelligence

**reasoning:** 
1) inductive: from specific observations, make general statement
2) deductive: from general statments, examine the possibility to reach a specific conclusion

**learning:**
auditory 
episodic
motor 
observational
relational
spatial
stimulus response

speech recognition: what was spoken
voice recognition: who has spoken

An **agent** is anything that can perceive its **environment** through sensors and acts upon that environment through **effectors**.

Natural Language Understanding( NLU ) and Natural Language Generation( NLG )
Problems: Lexical Ambiguity, Syntax level ambiguity, referential ambiguity

intelligence is acquiring info, using that info for decision making. but it also includes thinking, creating new thoughts
we can see the intelligence in other animals, but we can't measure it

**Machine learning**
eg: play checker: computer learns the patterns which lead to win and which to loss

A computer is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, imroves with experience E.

**types of learnings**
1) Supervised learning
 we are giving algo input and output data, algo learns the association b/w input and output. predicts the output when nput is given.
**classes**: regression, classification
eg: cancer prediction problems

we can prove 
with how much accuracy can algo give results under what conditions. 
how much training data/iterations are required to keep result within some percentage.

it depends on domain knowledge, how tools of machine learning are used. will they work for this particular problem?

2) Unsupervised learning
in supervised learning we are given training data. input and output is provided. But in unsupervised learning you are not given answer for data.  you have to find some pattern in data.
eg: clustering, segmentation of customers, better quality sound in noise using independent component analysis algo

3) Reinforcement learning
based on rewards and punishments, learning
specify: good and bad behaviours
eg: robotics and web crawlers

gradient descent: sometimes depend on where we started with( or initial theta )
batch gradient descent: requires lot of calucations for large data for calculating theta(i)

stochastic gradient descent: faster for large data set, won't actually converge to actual minimum. parameters will wander around parameters which get us minimum.

linear subspace, basis of subspaces: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors_and_spaces/subspace_basis/v/linear-algebra-basis-of-a-subspace
echelon transformations: http://stattrek.com/matrix-algebra/echelon-transform.aspx
eigen value and vectors: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/alternate_bases/eigen_everything/v/linear-algebra-eigenvalues-of-a-3x3-matrix

usage of eigen values and vectors:
Eigenvectors make understanding linear transformations easy. They are the "axes" (directions) along which a linear transformation acts simply by "stretching/compressing" and/or "flipping"; eigenvalues give you the factors by which this compression occurs.

__todo__
read vector, prob, chp1
till chap 2
subspace and span usage and how to calculate
how to calculate rank of matrix

__questions__
why use mean square root error instead of modulus of error
why we use eigen space, echelon matrix ? what is their meaning
