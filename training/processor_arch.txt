processor has ALU, CU registers which needs instructions in binary to deal with memory which is data, bss segment for data and code/text segment for instructions, stack and heap 
assembly is similar to high level C
It maps high level globals, constants, functions, recursion to instruction sets of architecture
it makes easier to write code: recursion stacks is handled by assembler itself 

looks like interrupts given in assembly code are handled by system calls
