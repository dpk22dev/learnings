spring framework docs:
spring creates application context by reading xml, annotations; creates context based on various contexts provided : creating beans with scopes specified in config. -> singleton/session/request type of objects, classpath scanning dependent beans based on autowiring
we can extend to create own scope
management of beans lifecycle: can be extended, phases and order of loading
using @autowired based on type, qualifier spring creates bean. using @resource named bean is created 
we can use @postconstruct, @predestroy for caching data, logging etc
@respository: stereotype of a repository (also known as Data Access Object or DAO).
stereotype annotations: @Component, @Service, and @Controller
Meta-annotations can also be combined to create composed annotations. eg: @RestController composed of @Controller and @ResponseBody.
The Environment is an abstraction integrated in the container that models two key aspects of the application environment: profiles and properties.
