spring framework docs:
spring creates application context by reading xml, annotations; creates context based on various contexts provided : creating beans with scopes specified in config. -> singleton/session/request type of objects, classpath scanning dependent beans based on autowiring
we can extend to create own scope
management of beans lifecycle: can be extended, phases and order of loading
using @autowired based on type, qualifier spring creates bean. using @resource named bean is created 
we can use @postconstruct, @predestroy for caching data, logging etc
@respository: stereotype of a repository (also known as Data Access Object or DAO).
stereotype annotations: @Component, @Service, and @Controller
Meta-annotations can also be combined to create composed annotations. eg: @RestController composed of @Controller and @ResponseBody.
The Environment is an abstraction integrated in the container that models two key aspects of the application environment: profiles and properties.
http://www.techferry.com/articles/spring-annotations.html

@componentscan 
com.ex.hello will scan for components, beans in current package/sub-package eg com.ex.hello.p1, com.ex.hello.p2 but not com.ex.meow

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDchAEHIht0 explains writing spring boot starter project
getting started with spring boot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=aA4tfBGY6jY

beans are created in userconfiguration, autoconfiguration phases; autoconfiguration phase creates/overrides spring beans based on how starter project is created
properties need to be handled by starter project developer which shall be provided by application developers; custom validation annotation can be created in starter project

autoconfiguration report tells what and why different autoconfigurations were processed, shown in debug project
custom failure analyzer can be written in starter project to hide lots of errors to developers, showing relevant errors in better way

what are beans: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17193365/what-in-the-world-are-spring-beans

you can use Springâ€™s integration with AspectJ to configure objects that have been created outside the control of an IoC container.

you can write dependencies, constructor args of beans in their config files. graph of beans is created and exception is raised in constructor injected beans; setter injected beans are ok with this.
for setter beans
<property name="beanOne"><ref bean="anotherExampleBean"/></property>

for constructor beans
<constructor-arg><ref bean="anothherExampleBean"/></constructor-arg>

in spring boot2.0
reactive spring stack, tries to bring node style non blocking api using flux to java, good for handling large number of requests, interaction with db async, internal server calls
uses servlet 3.0 async api, uses netty instead of tomcat

how binding among multiple projects/modules done as in sagan
are the guides enough
can annotations be extended, they say @springapplication consists of @componentscan, @enableautoconfig etc, how its done
what is opinion, aspect
how is testing different froom phpunit, does it include funcitonal, other tests

how annotations are processed, 
order of exec
	- there is order of execution, how?
how ordering of beans creation in autoconfiguration
what is actuator, archetype
should we commit .mvn, mvnw files etc? what files should be left out
workign of JPA, repository
using DTO as bean
debugging with browser request

Not able to put @component over enum
have you use commandrunner for different jobs
should we use entity and repos, dtos acc to clients in different packages
