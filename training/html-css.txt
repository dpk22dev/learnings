yes we can but it will not be validated by w3c

who defines the value of attributes me or Design maker?
what are indentation rules
in div how do we know whether this class if preexisting 

we have to define it ourselves.

why blank <em></em> tags are used
we add css class to these empty tags to put some image as background or some other styling...

what are different changes that arise in browsers. what we do to make it all browser-compatible
How to use developer tools? are they same in all browsers

understand what element is to be used by identifying and what type of container to be used

why hidden input types are used

~~we are giving image src how is it changing continuously?~~
~~because link is php[1.2] [2.1]~~

~~when to use table and list~~
we generally use div

how space is present here between two divs [1.1]
because of float in div

how to know how much pixel to be given for size or padding
we use photoshop to get the exact height, width of pics, it is useful in sprite also
desiner creates UI and gives to coder.  coder analyzes UI in photoshop and gets to know font-family, size background info etc...


in search jobs how items shown using scroll down are shown

important tags:
meta -> http-equiv, name, property, content
link -> rel, href
script -> language, src, type, 
 div -> id, class, style
table --> border, cellpadding, cellspacing, 
TR, TD
 noscript
 form -> post
 lists - ul, li
 a -> href, style, target
p -> class
em
span
strong
img -> height, width, style, alt, src, style
iframe
label
input -> class, type
textarea

[ ] In HTML 4.01, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML.
	 HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.

**block vs inline**
block: tags used to define the structure. such as <div>, <table>, <list>. they have default **display: block**... 
		so they acquire width of their parent block. they can contain other block and inline elements
		
inline: tags used to show the content. such as <p>, <a> . they have default **display: inline... **
		so they acquire width according to their content. next element is put just after this element.
		they can contain inline elements only.
		
**using sprite**
rather than sending each image differently we create single image in photoshop and send it. generally we get icon from this image

**margin and padding**
padding is within the border; it is internal to container. 
margin is external to border; container is effected in this case.

order of sizes is clockwise: Up Right Down Left

**display:**
display: inline      => shows inline elements
	     : block	=> shows block elements
		: none => element is not displayed
	: inline-block => displays elements inline but top and down margin changes are allowed

css can be external: in .css file external             ( lowest priority)
		   internal: on the top of html page   ( high priority)
		   nline: using style tag                               ( highest priority)

**float( providing space between block elements):**
rather than spacing between inline elements we use float with block elements. so these elements rather than going in vertical 
become horizontal. 
eg: float: left float:right 
so space is automatically provided between these block elements

@media tag can be used to define page layout according to device
