docker pull docker.infoedge.com:5000/naukri/php_nginx_build
docker tag docker.infoedge.com:5000/naukri/php_nginx_build naukri/php_nginx_build

docker run -d -P --name consul -v /opt/consulBinary:/opt/consulBinary depk/ubuntu:v1
docker ps -a | grep consul
 docker exec -it consul bash
docker rm consul

**Migration on dev server:**
remember to add port( 8886 ) in wp-config.php file
for each site: site, url in its wp_BLOGID_options table should be updated acc to new domain with port
 for careersites: domain_mapping table should be updated with port in its entry
site_mapping should be updated as well for careersites â€” i think
