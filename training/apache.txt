reading apache2 conf says that running apache2 directly from [[/usr/bin]] apache2 will run it without configurations; so use [[/etc/init.d/apache2]] start 

=> diff b/w init.d and init
/etc/init.d contains scripts used by the System V init tools (SysVinit). This is the traditional service management package for Linux, containing the init program (the first process that is run when the kernel has finished initializing¹)

/etc/init contains configuration files used by Upstart. Upstart is a young service management package championed by Ubuntu. Files in /etc/init are configuration files telling Upstart how and when to start, stop, reload the configuration, or query the status of a service.

.d in directory names typically indicates a directory containing many configuration files or scripts for a particular situation (e.g. /etc/apt/sources.list.d contains files that are concatenated to make a virtual sources.list;

so change .d directory files and these will be merged to generate conf file.

in rewrite: url is matched against url; if url gets matched against rewrite rule then its rewrite conditions are checked... its opposite. 

flags in rewrites:
L: last rule to be executed; be careful about .htaccess files
P: request to be processed by proxy
QSA:
F : 		reply with 403 forbidden 

**conf/magic**
Despite its inviting name, the "magic" file is a difficult file to read through. The magic file stores information about MIME types. MIME types are essentially identifiers a web server and web client will use to indicate that a file is of a particular type. For example, "application/pdf" is the MIME type for a PDF file.

**interaction of apache php and mysql**

php is language which needs to be interpreted, which can be done by CLI for php ( much like shell for shell scripts ) or php interpreter, it can be directly converted to machine code using php compiler, converted into byte codes and run on VM like hiphop.

at first web server could send static content back to user. but to generate dynamic content on server scripts are run. it can be compiled like c/c++ programs or interpreted like perl. so CGI 1.1 was developed for communication b/w server and programs. php interpreter needs $_REQUEST etc parameters can be passed to it using CGI.

but CGI is not efficient. fast CGI was used. php is run as separate process and requests are fed to it one by one. each fastCGI process( like running php interpreter ) can handle multiple requests. fastCGI is just protocol.

SCGI is protocol like fastCGI but easier to implement

	read user guide, for understanding working


check conf
apache/bin/apachectl -t


nginx/sbin/nginx -s reload

apache dir: [[/etc/apache2]]
[[/usr/share/apache2]]
[[/var/www]]

[[/srv/www/wp-content]]

a2enmod , a2dismod → for enabling and disabling modules

for any configuration look into [[/etc/apache2,]] [[/etc/php5,]] [[/etc/mysql/ ,]] 
imp dirs: [[/var/lib/...,]] [[/var/log...,]] /var/run/....

apache2    

mysql-server, mysql-client

php5, libapache2-mod-php5

[[/etc/init.d/apache2]] restart

apt search php5 gives you list of php5 modules for other functionalities.

php5-mysql, php5-curl, php5-sqlite etc..

then install phpmyadmin

/etc/my.cnf  for changing mysql configurations
