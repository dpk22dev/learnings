mongo has dropped support for master slave config, in place use sharded arch

mongo in cluster
https://www.linode.com/docs/databases/mongodb/build-database-clusters-with-mongodb
config/data server: mongod
query server: mongos
config server stores meta info about cluster, database, collection, chunks; gets updated on chunk movement, node failures etc. generally 1/3 config servers are used, which remain in-sync using 2PC. query server gets updated on change in config server info. queries are routed to data servers thruogh query servers, sometimes query server aggregate data too.


sharding in mongod
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/#data-partitioning
sharding can be done at database/collection level
First sharding at database level needs to be enabled, then at collection level. Collections are not automatically distributed across shards until you enable sharding on them and then add data.
we can dynamically add/remove shards, mongo will auto balance the chunks of data

schema design in mongodb

Denormalizing only makes sense when there’s an high ratio of reads to updates.
how you model your data depends – entirely – on your particular application’s data access patterns


capped collection : good for logs, caching
You cannot delete documents from a capped collection. To remove all documents from a collection, use the drop() method to drop the collection and recreate the capped collection. No sharding. 

 maximum BSON document size is 16 megabytes.

For the MMAPv1 storage engine, intervening write operations on a document may result in a cursor that returns a document more than once if that document has changed.

query steps:
collection, query-criteria, projection, cursor-modifier

aggregation steps: 
match stage, group stage

 A collection can only have one text search index, but that index can cover multiple fields.
