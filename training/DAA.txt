**insights**
updation vs read O(N) vs O(1)
store numbers vs differences in array

how 2's complement numbers are stored

how floating point numbers are stored

practical coding books:

segment tree: with extra storage, kind of working like heap: O(logN)
using double pointers while traversing linked list
whenever you have to do things backward
merge-sort of llist, instead of sending count of sublist1, sublist2; set last pointer of sublists as null, and send for merging

when asked for avoiding loop: try recursion

binary numbers are basically unique combinations of powers of 2. if we consider base x( say 5 ) they can be used as sum of unique powers of x.
when want to find diff at bit level, we can store kind of inverted index of each bit; even storing is not required, x = numbers with bit set at pos, then n-x = numbers with bit empty at pos

depth vs height of tree

when need to update value in tree, get diff keep on applying downwards. eg: segment tree

__tricky:__

__quesitons and doubts:__
logic behind storing numbers in BITree parent_index = index + inx & -inx
