questions:
how autoscaling happens, do vm's need to be cut explicitely
adding of extra node in say ES needs config change, re indexing : how is it done for example done by aws cluster of ES
how does configuration file shared among pods: changes in cluster state intimated to members -> etcd
how data files are provided to say mysql pod: shared disk or what?
