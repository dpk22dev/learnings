The relational algebra is pro-cedural, whereas the tuple relational calculus and domain relational calculus are
nonprocedural.

**types of databases**:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-sql-and-nosql-databases-and-different-database-models
databases use model whcih are basically schema or schemaless.
most popular in schema modeled databases is relational database which uses table for logically store info. eg: mysql, mssql, oracle. but they follow SQL standards. so they are SQL databases. it is due to this underlying schema they have additional checks and keep dataa in good shape.
in memory 

databases whcih don;t need schema like redis, mongodb, cassandra, neo4j are nosql( as they don't follow any SQL standard). they don't need schema to be predefined. various checks are omitted.

**Database design:**
while designinig database, for uniqueness of two or more coloumns we can use md5 of them as store 

if insertion is less we can create unique key on multiple coloumns but as table size increases insertion will get too slower, but we can have performance in selection
key should be less than 188 chars so be careful while make url as key
eg: comp_id, md5( ip:useragent ), date

we can shard db, create tables acc to say blog_id if there is no join these tables can be put on different databases. if there asre joins either create single table 
eg: naukM_2_stat, naukM_3_stat vs naukM_stat

never add count coloumns to table eg: mobcount, desktopcount, its not good from scalability point of view instead put system, os, browser coloumns
we can count acc to these entries
also we can combine them in single key eg: pid can be combination of page:referar:system:browser, but we have to use substring while querying table in this case
eg: comp_id, date, pid( page, referer ), count, system

if key size is getting bigger say more than 180 then use __md5 of coloumns can be used as primary key__
while designing db/table think of unique key as coloumns ( or combination of coloumns ) whose value we don't want to repeat
if we are using primary-key, unique-key; both of them should not  be violated, if anyone of them is violated data won't be inserted or updated
â€” so think what you would do ( on duplicate key ) scenario in insert, update or delete cases

although join look similar to subquery, but they can be faster if on coloumn is indexed

why we need primary key when unique key is there:
because unique key can be null
its good to able to uniquely identify rows in table, when designing  a table find out group of key which uniquely identify table => these are superkeys; we select minimal group of coloumns => candidate key; chosen candidate key as primary key and remaining set of candidate key aer alternate keys

if coloumn A has null values, adding unique constraint doesn't complain as mysql thinks null can be anything, null is not equal to null, this query will pass
but if coloumn has equal data this query will fail

capped collection : good for logs, caching
You cannot delete documents from a capped collection. To remove all documents from a collection, use the drop() method to drop the collection and recreate the capped collection. No sharding. 

 maximum BSON document size is 16 megabytes.

For the MMAPv1 storage engine, intervening write operations on a document may result in a cursor that returns a document more than once if that document has changed.

query steps:
collection, query-criteria, projection, cursor-modifier

aggregation steps: 
match stage, group stage

 A collection can only have one text search index, but that index can cover multiple fields.

******** questions *****
diff b/w json and bson, why not store simply as json string
why different data-types
in 2PC/3phase commit what happens if replicas commit and ack returned is lost
how does transations happens on replicas, does locking happens over there
