**types of databases**:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-sql-and-nosql-databases-and-different-database-models
databases use model whcih are basically schema or schemaless.
most popular in schema modeled databases is relational database which uses table for logically store info. eg: mysql, mssql, oracle. but they follow SQL standards. so they are SQL databases. it is due to this underlying schema they have additional checks and keep dataa in good shape.
in memory 

databases whcih don;t need schema like redis, mongodb, cassandra, neo4j are nosql( as they don't follow any SQL standard). they don't need schema to be predefined. various checks are omitted. 

any of modeled database can

**Database design:**
while designinig database, for uniqueness of two or more coloumns we can use md5 of them as store 

if insertion is less we can create unique key on multiple coloumns but as table size increases insertion will get too slower, but we can have performance in selection
key should be less than 188 chars so be careful while make url as key
eg: comp_id, md5( ip:useragent ), date

we can shard db, create tables acc to say blog_id if there is no join these tables can be put on different databases. if there asre joins either create single table 
eg: naukM_2_stat, naukM_3_stat vs naukM_stat

never add count coloumns to table eg: mobcount, desktopcount, its not good from scalability point of view instead put system, os, browser coloumns
we can count acc to these entries
also we can combine them in single key eg: pid can be combination of page:referar:system:browser, but we have to use substring while querying table in this case
eg: comp_id, date, pid( page, referer ), count, system

if key size is getting bigger say more than 180 then use __md5 of coloumns can be used as primary key__
while designing db/table think of unique key as coloumns ( or combination of coloumns ) whose value we don't want to repeat
if we are using primary-key, unique-key; both of them should not  be violated, if anyone of them is violated data won't be inserted or updated
â€” so think what you would do ( on duplicate key ) scenario in insert, update or delete cases

although join look similar to subquery, but they can be faster if on coloumn is indexed

why we need primary key when unique key is there:
because unique key can be null
its good to able to uniquely identify rows in table, when designing  a table find out group of key which uniquely identify table => these are superkeys; we select minimal group of coloumns => candidate key; chosen candidate key as primary key and remaining set of candidate key aer alternate keys

if coloumn A has null values, adding unique constraint doesn't complain as mysql thinks null can be anything, null is not equal to null, this query will pass
but if coloumn has equal data this query will fail

**maximum concurrent connetions in mysql**

based on mysql environment variables #connections can be increased: default is 150

create table info_one(
Name varchar(90),
Email varchar(50),
DOB date,
Gender char(1),
Mobile varchar(20),
landline varchar(20),
city varchar(50),
education_level char(1)

 DATETIMESTAMP: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format
TIMESTAMP: A timestamp between midnight, January 1, 1970 and sometime in 2037.  same as DATETIMESTAMP without hyphens


***** diff b/w char and varchar *****
VARCHAR stores a variable number of bytes for only the space required by the content.
CHAR stores a fixed size of however many bytes you specify for your table, no matter how many characters occupy a field of this type per row.

BLOB: char max length upto 65535, used to store binary data such as images; sorts and comparisons are case sensitive
TEXT: char max length upto 65535

TINYBLOB: max length 255 char
TINYTEXT: max length 255 char

MEDIUMBLOB: maximum length of 16777215 characters
MEDIUMTEXT: maximum length of 16777215 characters

LONGBLOB: maximum length of 4294967295 characters.  
LONGTEXT:  maximum length of 4294967295 characters. 

use mysql_free_result() to free cursor memory space after work done.

***** REGEXP in mysql *****
SELECT name FROM person_tbl WHERE name REGEXP '^st';

AUTOCOMMIT = 1:  each SQL statement (within a transaction or not) is considered a complete transaction.
else transaction completes when COMMIT is written explicitely.

***** innoDB for transactions *****
If you plan to use transactions in your MySQL programming, then you need to create your tables in a special way. Support for InnoDB tables requires a specific compilation parameter when compiling MySQL from source.

***** running mysql on multiple instances *****
very good blog
http://naveensnayak.wordpress.com/2013/11/10/mysql-multiple-instances-on-ubuntu/

use \c  on screen to abort current query. don't use ctrl + C.
use \G for proper coloumn wise result of query

**schemas in mysql**
http://mysqlintheenterprise.com/2013/03/21/a-visual-guide-to-the-mysql-performance-schema/
performance_schema, which records runtime statistics from the MySQL database. 

**getting query for create table: **
show create table site_mapping;

**on duplicate key:**
site_mapping: ( ID, flag -> primary key ),  site -> unique key
insert into site_mapping values( 1, 'a', 'n' ) on duplicate key id=id, flag=flag;
if multiple keys are used in duplicate key, it is OR of key that is used; eg if primary key coloums are duplicate or unique key coloumn is duplicate then only id, flag are updated....
it's important which keys are we updating, here we are updating id, flag not site.... 

**order of execution**
FROM
ON
JOIN
WHERE
GROUP BY
WITH CUBE or WITH ROLLUP
HAVING
SELECT
DISTINCT
ORDER BY
TOP


select City, CNT=Count(1)
From Address
Where State = 'MA'
Group By City
Having Count(1)>5

***** multi master *****
m-m is m-s on both ends, so it has inherent problems of m-s but these problems can be solved using mysql clustter but it also has its own problems
m-s uses innoDB, while cluster uses NDB

m-s is good for replication

write on one master is reflected on other after some time. read/write can happen on anyone.
in master slave, writes done on slave arenot reflcected on master.
making them master slave and vice-versa is not enough; to avoid collisions on write, we need to make setting.



The problem is that asynchronous replication will incur collisions and conflicts which needs to be resolved smartly by smartly-written and flawlessly implemented algorithms. You won't have that. Use MySQL cluster setup instead, if you need multi-master operations and can handle the limitations it brings.

looks like multi master has its problems also.

**locks vs transactions**

__quest:__
diff b/w relational / non-relational
diff b/w sql / nosql 
diff b/w above two

does innodb provide transaction, concurrency -> by locking or not
	-in single node, m-s arch
does ndb provide transaction, concurrency -> by locking or not
	-in single node, m-s arch

possible problems with m-s and clustered env

locking in mysql; is it storage engine dependent?
what things are storage engine dependent
transaction, concurrency

~~can we index normal coloumn~~
what does indexing multiple coloumns mean
how does locking coloumns work

capped collection : good for logs, caching
You cannot delete documents from a capped collection. To remove all documents from a collection, use the drop() method to drop the collection and recreate the capped collection. No sharding. 

 maximum BSON document size is 16 megabytes.

For the MMAPv1 storage engine, intervening write operations on a document may result in a cursor that returns a document more than once if that document has changed.

query steps:
collection, query-criteria, projection, cursor-modifier

aggregation steps: 
match stage, group stage

 A collection can only have one text search index, but that index can cover multiple fields.

******** questions *****
diff b/w json and bson, why not store simply as json string
why different data-types
