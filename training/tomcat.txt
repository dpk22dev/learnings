CATALINA_HOME:

pojo should not extend class, implement interface, have annotations eg: java beans
frameworks like spring promote pojo based practice

Hibernate : ORM for java

configuration metadata which is needed for the container to know the followings:
How to create a bean
Bean's lifecycle details

You can mix both, Constructor-based and Setter-based DI but it is a good rule of thumb to use constructor arguments for mandatory dependencies and setters for optional dependencies.

questions:

diff b/w making class file and interpreting and compiled java file
where do javabeans, hibernate and struts come into play
what is good way of writing jsp, its not good to write jsp with html itself
