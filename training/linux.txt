====== linux ======
Created Monday 01 June 2015

upstart is for linux

lvs: linux virtual server is used for load balancing among services

notes: unix network programming volume 2, w. richard stevens
IPC:
pipe, fifo, system V message queue, posix message queue

synchronisation:
system V semaphores were added for synchronization of system V shared memory
posix semaphores were added for synchronization of posix shared memory
mutex and conditional variables: for threads but can  be used for process synchronizaiton
read-write lock

there is difference as system V semaphore, shared memory is kernel persistence while posix semaphore and shared memory is kernel persistent but can be filesystem persistence; but processes don't survive reboot also performance impact, its bad to choose filesystem persistence

for communication using PIPE or FIFO IPCObject is shared among processes
as the book describes there are various effects of fork, exec and _exit on various descriptors used for IPC as depicted in table
