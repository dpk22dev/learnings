mov: metal oxide varister; when voltage exceeds it blows up
fuse: when more current passes, it melts

inductor stores energy in magnetic field, no effect in case of dc its just a resister with few milliohms, but in ac it can act as low pass filter, smoothing the flow of ac. they oppose instantaneous change in current. store energy due to motion of electron => kinetic energy.

capacitor stores energy in form of electric field. after some time, when potential reaches to potential of power source, it stops flow of current, when source is removed flow starts again.
no effect on ac source though. they oppose instantaneous change in voltage. store energy due to position of electron => potential energy.


transformer can be used to convert 200V ac to 12V ac, which can be converted to pulsating 12V DC(  fluctuates acc to input ) using bridge rectifier, using capacitor we can get fixed 5V DC.

eg: 
crystal is used at pin 18, 19 which sets frequency for internal oscillator.

diode test for transistor
for (BJT): bipolr junction transistor
npn: current from Base to emitter and base to collector but not in between emitter and collector
pnp: current from emitter to base and collector to base but no current between emitter and collector

if we hold transistor with flat surface up, left to right are emitter base collector

for mosfet:
scr: silicon controlled rectifier

we can using voltmeter ohm meter to find if there is connection b/w different pins

for drivers: visit https://www.spartfun.com

programming:
DDRX: puts defined pin of X register as input or output
PORTX: outputs to pin of X register
INPX: inputs from pin of X register

common logic:
use AND to unset a pin
use OR to set a pin
use XOR to toggle pin

timers and counters:
timer inside atmega is within 10% of accurate value, use external timer if want.
timer/counter register: TCNT0 : 8bit, TCNT1: 16bit

using interrupts instead of control registers:
instead of polling TCNT1, we would use OCR1A(output control register to check for event say completion of 1 sec)
WGM12( waveform generation  mode) will use CTC(clear time on compare) to cause TCNT to become 0 again
TIMSK mask is used to enable interrupt from OCR1A

LCD: is slow and busy
check if its busy
enable is on: only now lcd listens for data/command
put R/W off: for sending data/command, we don't want to listen from lcd; put it on when want to listen
RS on/off for data/command
send data/command
do nop, so that slow lcd gets enough time to read from data lines
put enable = off, so that lcd can start working

voltage regulator:
max 603, 604 for low-dropout( means output voltage is closer to input voltage)
7805 for high dropout

potentiometer or variable resistor are used to divide voltage in cirvuit.

some sensors give voltage in range of voltage. ADC 8bit(  0-255 ) or 10bit( 0-1023) gives output acc to input voltage value.

accelerometer: MEMS( micro electro-mechanical systems )

analog wave can take any value say for voltage it can take any value between 0 and 5v; but digital signal can take only 0 or 5v.
analog signal can be shown using sine wave or triangular wave which has continous values. digital signal can be shown using square wave, which can take 0 or 1 instaneous values.
suppose if we switch on/off path in circuit fastly, we can generate digital signal of some frequency based on cycles per second. for each cycle how much percentage time circuit was on, can gives use mean value of DC effective in ciruit.

PWM ( pulse width modulation ):
by changing duty cycle, we can change effective voltage in circuit.

phase corrected PWM: start measuring just left or right.


batteries:
high energy battery: store energy for longer duration
high power: high burst of energy
in motor vehicles, houses lead battery are used as they are cheap

fuse bits are just switches inside microcontroller, which can be changed by avrdude. eg we need to set fuse bits to accept external oscillator

I2C( i squeared c) or TWI( two wired interface): SCL( cloack ), SDL( data )
