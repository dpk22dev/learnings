running different things on different machines is helpful, as somethings might be dependent on some things whcih can break other things on upgrade.
apache security upgrade might break mysql. ...

we use puppet, chef... to start whole things up

challenge: keeping prod == test == dev env
getting forward on new version is easy, but rolling back is hard

in container language: microservices are just process in their own clean environment

**thrift**: we can write code in IDL, thrift parser will change that code in language service( kind of class with various funcitons); it generates code for server, client as demanded. we can include that code and few necessary files in our code to run the service on server and calling that service.

protocol buff vs json vs xml

protocol buff is best of all serializers, json doesn't provide schema, 

**nginx vs haproxy**
HAproxy is simpler (being just a tcp proxy without an http implementation), which makes it faster and less bug prone. The downside is that you can't route based on information in the http layer, like session cookies or url paths. nginx can also cache requests, which haproxy can't do.
Only use nginx when you actually need a web server, otherwise use haproxy.

Recently, nginx 1.9 introduced support for TCP load balancing - similar to what HAProxy is capable of. The one major drawback is that it does not support advanced backend health checks. This is required when running MySQL Galera Cluster, as we’ll explain in the next section. Note that this limitation is removed in the paid-only edition called NGINX Plus.

SSTable stands for Sorted Strings Table a concept borrowed from Google BigTable which stores a set of immutable row fragments in sorted order based on row keys.
