casting pointer to one struct to another:
mimicking object orientation in c
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3766229/casting-one-struct-pointer-to-other-c

we can use 
#ifndef buttonpress
#define buttonpress
.... various funcitons and methods ...
#endif

compiler will not include functions twice in this case

when creating different library and using them, consider wrapping in #ifndef and other libraries like stdlib might have to be included in both library and main-source files.
