====== design patterns ======
Created Tuesday 14 July 2015

SOLID:
actors, responsibility, use case

Creational Patterns
These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new opreator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Object Pool, Prototype, Singleton

Structural Patterns
These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data, Proxy	

Behavioral Patterns
These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, Observer,
State, Strategy, Template, visitor
