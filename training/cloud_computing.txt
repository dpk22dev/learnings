====== cloud computing ======
Created Thursday 10 March 2016

Cloud Computing provides us means of accessing the applications as utilities over the Internet.

Cloud Computing refers to manipulating, configuring, and accessing the hardware and software resources remotely. It enalbles platform independency, as s/w is not reqd to be installed locally.

**Models:**
1) Deployment model: access to cloud
	public, private, hybrid, commounity
	
2) Service model
	IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, XaaS

Pro: Rapid elasticity

Risks:
**security:** data management and infra is provided to third party
**LockIn: **difficulty in moving from one CSP( cloud service provideer ) to another
**Insecure or Incomplete data deletion**

we should understand do we really need this?
Cloud computing value proposition
cloud computing strategy planning

we should choose CCP wisely considering maintainance and technical service provided.

**technologies behind cloud computing:**
virtualization
service oriented architecture
grid computing
utility computing

**cloud infra should implement:**
transparency
scalability
intelligent monitoring
security

compute
storage
data services
other services: 
machine learning
translation
networking services
scaling and load balancing
management and monitoring

Load balancing, microservices, authorization, SQL and noSQL databases, memcache, traffic splitting, logging, search, versioning, roll out and roll backs, and security scanning are all supported natively and are highly customizable.

Software Development Kits (SDKs) for App Engine manages your application locally, while the Google Cloud Platform Console manages your application in production.

GCE = compute engine VM: IaaS
GKE =  container engine
GAE = app engine: PaaS
	sandbox: google provided services
	endpoints: apis for android or in general
	for in between: app engine managed VMs
