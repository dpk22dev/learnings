if in intermediate step there is some arr of elements; and need for sorting to get result => consider traversing original array from right side, sometimes it saves sorting

O(n2) -> O(n): keeping two arrays calculated data for left of array and right of array; then loop through each element to compute

when comparing strings rabin-karp based hashcode can be useful; also for just comparing anagrams keeping charater frequency array can do comparison in O(1)

in matrix chain multiplication kind of problems, we can create nxn matrix but don't use first column

sometimes in DP eg: painters problem we jump to 3d array of 2ds, but 2D is enough,
partitioning n tasks into k persons; minimizing over giving 1 to n tasks to 1 person and remaining tasks to k-1 persons
minimizing over giving 1 to n tasks to x persons and remaining tasks to k-x persons, ultimately it boils down to same as above

for representing number on two sides, we can have bit mask on left side, its negate will be on right hand side

for buy/sell stock problem, keeping track of min, maxProfit while going left to right to ith element; keeping track of max, maxProfit while going right to left to ith element can be used to find 2 trades to get max profit

if diff of count of odd bits - count of even bits is multiple of 3 then number is multiple of 3

when asked to print power, multi without using maths, bitwise operators think of using recursion

BST: only preorder/post is suffiecient, as we know position of root, elements smaller than root will form left subtree, greater than root will form rigth subtree
Complete: level order is enough, 1,2,4,8.. nodes at each level . eg: hea**p**( com**p**lete )
full: each node has 0/2 childeren. while storing preorder need bit indicatior for leaf / internal nodes
BT: preoder + inorder

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-an-array-arr-find-the-maximum-j-i-such-that-arrj-arri/
we can use lmin array for storing min element on left side, rmax for max element on right side. then iterating i over lmin, j over rmax; we can find pair(i,j) when diff(i,j) is max

when we need to find path existence from s to d in maze, queue is ok; but when finding shortes path, acc to dijkstra we need priority queue
looping over points in maze:
bool isValid(int row, int col) k{ 
	return (row >= 0) && (row < ROW) && (col >= 0) && (col < COL); 
} 
int rowNum[] = {-1, 0, 0, 1}; 
int colNum[] = {0, -1, 1, 0}; 
  
 for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) { 
			int row = pt.x + rowNum[i]; 
			int col = pt.y + colNum[i]; 
		 isValid( row, col )
}

count of digit in perfect powers of 10
count( 10^d ) = 9 * count( 10 ^ (d-1) ) + 10^(d-1)
for other numebers, store count of numbers in arr as 0-9, 10-99, 100-999, as all digits are distributed equally in this case
not as 0-10, 11-100 <- 0,1 are not equal in this case

in seive of erastothenes, we tend to neglect multiple of every number which works; but should be neglecting multiples of prime numbers to reduce complexity; in case of finding prime factors, we can increment factor count using above algo only if we deal with multiples of primes 

while storing minEle in stack question: we can store negative value as marker, or 2*minEle - x as value, when popping check if value if less than current min value, old min value can be found as 2 * minEle - current

general strategy for 2 player optimal playing game, when picking coins, get sum of odd coins, even coins: always pick odd/even coins whichever gives max value forcing only opposite choice to competetor

in shapes like rectangle, sometimes its better to fix one side as max, other side as min of two sides eg as done in box stacking problem for easier comparisons

modulo ops
(a + b) % n = ( a % n + b % n  ) % n
( a*b ) % m = ( a%m * b%m) % m
(a-b)%n = (a + (n - (b%n)) ) %  n // if a-b is -ve and lib doesn't gives positive ouput for negative numbers

in case of backtracking prune the tree with simple optimizzations which can bring running time 1000 times low; like using symmetry we can decide to move down only and multiply number of solutions by 2

for finding subset whose sum is equal to k; we can create two subsets and generate corresponding subsets and store sum in Sa, Sb; then find combinaation between Sa, Sb which can give sum as k -> O( 2^n/2 )
finding all subsets and finding k as sum -> O( 2 ^ n ) which is much higher

for finding minumum queries, during preprocessing we can store logarithmic difference of indexes( nlgn ) in say hashmap, for min value we can calculate in O(nlgn) time. we store min value for 0-1,1-2, 2-3.. 0-3,1-4,2-5.. 0-7,1-8,2-9.. if span of query is not perfect multiple of 2, we find just minimum power of 2 -> k, find min as min( rmq(a,a+k-1), rmq(b-k, b) )

fenwick/bitree: 
index x contains sum of elements at [x-k+1, x], where k is max power value of 2 that divides x; 6 k is 2, 8 k is 8, 16 k is 16 not 4
sum of elements in range (1,k) can be divided into O(lgn) ranges whose sum is in BITree precalculated
when value at position i changes, it needs to change lgn ranges of which i is part of.

for handling range update, single query, store diff of values in array; for udpating (a,b) with k, increase arr[a] by and decrease arr[b] by k.

-x = ~x + 1
set kth bit of x to 1: x | 1 << k
set kth bit of x to 0: x & ~(1<<k)
invert kth bit of x: x ^ (1<<k)
set last one bit of x to zero: x & (x-1)
set all 1 bits to zero : x & -x
invert all set bits after last one bit : x |(x-1)

all grpah algos https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/16221
check if graph is bipartite
do bfs: if adj nodes already have same color its not bipartite otherwise its

articulation vertex: vertices removing which graph wont remain connected, tarjan algo
bridge: edges removing which graph wont remain connected, tarjan algo
graph is strongly connected if there is path between all pair of vertices; it is different than graph without articulation points or bridges
strongly connected components: tarjan or kasaraju

number of factors on n if we have prime factors
84 -> 2^2 . 3 . 7
t( 84 ) : (2+1)*(1+1)*(1+1) -> 12
s( 84 ): (2^3-1/2-1) * (3^2-1/3-1) * ( 7^2-1/7-1)
p( 84 ):  n ^ (t(n)/2) : 84^6
