====== hbase ======
Created Wednesday 19 December 2018

server: [[http://localhost:16010/master-status]]

standalone mode: zookeeper is requried
in distributed mode, each node runs hbase daemons primary and backup HMaster, HRegionServers, Zookeeper

hive uses hdfs for storing data, so deletes are not possible; but hbase provides that
should be distributed, sorted data, sparse data storage
we can use hadoop as filesystem to store hbase's data

under the hood MemStore is a sorted ConcurrentSkipListMap, which gets serialized to hbase file format which is kind of b+tree ish structure

__questions__
how is it diff from spark/storm real time analytics
~~if hbase uses hadoop, how deletetion and real time access of data is happening~~
	~~does hbase uses hadoop as storage unit or it has its own way of storage like cassandra~~
 ~~how deletion happens in hbase~~	
	using tombstones
how bloom filters are helpful

__todo__
