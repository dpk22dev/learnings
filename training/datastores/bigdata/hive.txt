quickstart to hive
https://www.edureka.co/blog/hive-tutorial/
you can couple Hive with other tools to use it in many other domains. For example, Tableau along with Apache Hive can be used for Data Visualization, Apache Tez integration with Hive will provide you real time processing capabilities, etc.  

setup hive on yarn

beeline can be run using:
after moving to /opt/hive/apache-hive-3.1.1-bin
beeline -u jdbc:hive2://

hive service, meta store service

 HiveCLI is now deprecated in favor of Beeline, which is client
hiveserver2 is based on hadoop, 
Hive compiler generates map-reduce jobs for most queries.

bin/hive --service runs any of below services:
beeline cleardanglingscratchdir cli fixacidkeyindex help hiveburninclient hiveserver2 hplsql jar lineage llapdump llap llapstatus metastore metatool orcfiledump rcfilecat schemaTool strictmanagedmigration tokentool version

hive vs hbase
 Ideally comparing Hive vs. HBase might not be right because HBase is a database and Hive is a SQL engine for batch processing of big data.

questions
is hive just stores tabular data on hdfs and runs queries using map-reduce famework
