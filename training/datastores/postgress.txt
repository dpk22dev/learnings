A database can contain one or multiple schemas and each schema belongs to only one database. a schema is a namespace that contains named database objects such as tables, views, indexes, data types, functions, stored procedures and operators.
Users can only access objects in the schemas that they own. It means they cannot access any objects in the schemas that do not belong to them.

search_path has $user value which causes logged-in user to search in his name schema.
