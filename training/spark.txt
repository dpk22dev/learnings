SparkContext can connect to several types of cluster managers: standalone, mesos, yarn
batch as well real time processing supported

we create lineage( DAG ) of transformations, action

spark vs storm

workloads: interactive, batch, 


For HA
standby masters using zookeeper


__questions__
how is it different from hive and storm
how does mapping of RDD and transformations happen with map-reduce
does spark uses YARN, HDFS for jobs, RDD storage and computation
	iwhy is it faster but map reduce is not
	why it has workers and executors instead of yarn 


__todo__
