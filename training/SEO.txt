====== SEO ======
Created Thursday 14 August 2014

unique, short, descriptive page-titles
non-repetitive words in meta description tag
improve structure of URL --> mod_rewrite
duplicate content: redirect url or canonical tag
make navigation based on home-page, 
make breadcrumbs like home -> page1 -> page2 ->... etc on top/bottom
create two sitemaps: a list of pages on website for users and XMLsitemp
navigation based entirely on drop-down menus, images, or animations
think and use unique, exclusive content
 optimizing your image filenames and alt text makes it easier for image search projects
avoid using generic filenames like "image1.jpg", "pic.gif", "1.jpg" when possibleâ€”some sites with thousands of images might consider automating the naming of images
create image site map for bot
Encrypting the content or password-protecting it with .htaccess are more secure methods if u don't want rogue search engines to crawl the page
If you or your site's users link to a site that you don't trust and/or you don't want to pass your site's reputation, use nofollow.
Automatically add "nofollow" to comment columns and message boards
for example you are giving comment-spamming on your page and don't want spider to crawl that page; use no-follow
for mobile sites mobile site-map should be given to search engine
allow any User-agent including "Googlebot-Mobile" to access your site
 Check that your mobile-friendly URLs' DTD declaration is in an appropriate mobile format such as XHTML Mobile or Compact HTML 
make sure that the user is redirected to the mobile version of the page for the same product, and not to the homepage of the mobile version of the site => -ve ranking
for same URL being shown differently on different devices; It's fine if the contents for Googlebot are different from those for Googlebot-Mobile. 
use google places to reach out customers
avoid artificially promoted to the top of these services; like stop-words: WINNER of lottery, foul words etc.. should be avoided

meta tag with noindex tells robot not to index page 
nofollow tells bot not to follow the links on page .... these two tags can be useful when creating new site. but when launching site remember to remove it.
