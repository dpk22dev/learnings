**redis core **
http://key-value-stories.blogspot.in/2015/01/redis-core-implementation.html

redis each entry takes ~ 100bytes

memcache:
diff b/w memcache and memcached php libraries
issue with storing false is interesting:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1825256/memcache-vs-memcached

run memcache deamon: 
memcached -d -m 256 -u nobody -p 11211 -l 127.0.0.1

**redis:**
if writes are less, use master : multiple-slave, for failover handling use sentinal whcih will make some slave master
if write-reads are even and frequent use cluster
Redis Cluster introduces some penalties (No multi-key operations. no pipelining...) that have a big impact in the typical Redis use case, so you should evaluate it carefully before implementing it.
