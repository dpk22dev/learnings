====== svn ======
Created Tuesday 27 May 2014

commit commits the changes to repo. update or revert only make changes locally.
conflict can arise only if same set of lines of single file are changed by multiple users

svn status: tells the status of files in local; we need to be sure about C -> conflicted files

**use svn merge --dry-run http://address before actual svn merge**
