***** capistrano *****
Capistrano has two main commands: 
cap: which is used for viewing and running the tasks
capify: which is used to set up a Rails project for use with Capistrano.

**Capfile:** is to Capistrano as Makefile is to make and Rakefile is to rake. Capistrano expects a Capfile to be present and to contain the tasks or to include a Ruby file that does.
