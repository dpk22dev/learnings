redis uses database 0,1,2 etc in single server mode. cluster mode doesn't support it.
we can dynamically add/remove nodes from cluster; 
redis distriutes keys based on mod operation, we can send key on same shard using hashtag eg:  {user1000}.following, then only user1000 will be used for hashing

redis cluster itself provide failover for selecting master from slave in case of failure; don't need sentinel in cluster

**questions**
master-slave vs sentinel vs cluster
what will happen if we have 9 sentinals and set 2 as quorum in some partitioning
how app will distribute writes to new master after quorum
what problems can arise in cluster quorum: edge cases
	writes when quorum is happening and master doesn't know about it
	old master comes up and thinks it master
are read-writes auto distributed
does it use consistent hashing
	no
how list/set are distributed
