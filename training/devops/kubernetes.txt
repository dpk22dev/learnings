we can use kompose to generate kubernetes config files from docker-compose
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-migrate-a-docker-compose-workflow-to-kubernetes
not good enough, wrongs the sequencing in generated files X; copy sample files instead probably

minikube provides local kubernetes cluster to play with
minikube start
sometimes we need to delete existing minikube using 
minikube delete

kubectl get namespaces
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=my-namespace

kubectl apply -f ./deployment.yaml
kubectl expose deployment tomcat-deployment --type=NodePort
minikube service tomcat-deployment --url
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod
kubectl attach container-id
kubectl exec -it container-id bash
kubectl label pods  pod-id key=value
kubectl create deployment nginx-dep --image=nginx
#run a particular image
kubectl run hazelcast --image=hazelcast:1.1 --port=5701
kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment-name
kubectl describe  services service-name
kubectl delete

kubectl api-resources --namespace=false(/true)

minikube addons enable ingress // to enable ingress addon in minikube

minikube service mongo-express-service // for external service while running in minikube external ip address is not assigned. to assign this ip we need to tell minikube explicitely, which assigns ip and opens browser
minikube stop

kind create cluster // to create cluster
kind delete cluster

kubectx k8s-cluster-1


we can use --type=LoadBalancer

earlier we had to handle images, containers and pods; now deployments can handle start/stop/resume/rolling/rollback
labels and selectors can beused to add meta info to cluster nodes

there are different types of controllers like replicaSet, deployments

deployment : include replicaSet, 
strategies:
recreate, rolliungUpdate, canaryDeployment( pods are added to pool and then removed to keep count constant), blue/green( up a parallel cluster, move traffic to new cluster using load balancer)

service: grouping of pods
service discovery happens through labels
types: cluster-ip, Node port, loadbalancer
job is controller in k8s â€” run to completion job, scheduled job

deployment manages a replicaSet manages pod which is abstraction over container

strucuture of k8s config
kind
metadata
spec // accordint to kind
	template // is a configuration within spec with its own metadata and spec
status // auto generated and added by k8s


based on storage type, spec of persistent-volume can change//. PV are not namespaced.
