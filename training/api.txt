POST: insert new data
The PATCH method is the correct choice here as you're updating an existing resource - the group ID.  PUT should only be used if you're replacing a resource in it's entirety. The HTTP methods PATCH can be used to update partial resources. For instance, when you only need to update one field of the resource, PUTting a complete resource representation might be cumbersome and utilizes more bandwidth.
