POST: insert new data
The PATCH method is the correct choice here as you're updating an existing resource - the group ID.  PUT should only be used if you're replacing a resource in it's entirety. The HTTP methods PATCH can be used to update partial resources. For instance, when you only need to update one field of the resource, PUTting a complete resource representation might be cumbersome and utilizes more bandwidth.

for restful  api : 
symfony not good, use phalcon, 

using restler for MyNaukriAPI


are we using oauth, but seen it in code
how do we design urls? like /user[[/profile/{id}]] ; why don't [[/user/id]] and then [[/profile/pid]]; eg: [[/user/profiles/{profileId}/certifications]]; can we create any url we want

we are using POST [[/user/profiles/{profileId}/certifications]] to insert new certifications, but we need to GET first and then PUT whole data; so instead we are using PATCH [[/user/profiles/{profileId}/certifications]] to limit data flowing?

by GET [[/user/profiles]]; aren't we exposing all user profiles to client; who can access and maybe modify data. maybe hateous can be helpful here => showing data for intended user only

can we use postman on test servers to hit api?
do we use hateos? like sending api links in api results?
