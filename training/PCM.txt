hypothesis or axiom or postulate can not be proved, it can be verified by experiments

good thought: sometimes macro things can't be explained using constituent micro things, like group of different colors make painting which has different meaning itself
group of atoms make molecules, which interact and make cells which becoming living

precision of an instrument, and accuracy of measurement

we can not use kinematic formulas for vertical circular motion because ~~velocity~~ accelerations is continuously changing, it linear motion that was constant

under conservative force work done by this force on object is independent of path taken, eg: g
non-conservative force eg: friction force
mechanical energy: if body can apply force to do displacement, it has mechanical energy.

conservation of momentum applicable: when external force on system is zero. it is kind of newton's third law of motion

system of particles form body. on motion distance between particles doesn't change, then its rigid body else flexible body.
point mass: linear, circular, oscillatory
system: translational, rotational( linear vel is different, but angular velocity is same ), rolling( translational+rotation)

moment: effect of physical quantity, 
eg 
moment of mass: m x r
moment of force: product of force and distance => torque

for system of particles, center of mass is point, when force is applied on each particle of body is same as applied on center of mass.

inertia is charactristic of object, due to which it opposes its change its velocity. for linear motion its mass, for rotational motion its moment of inertia 

if there is no forced pivot, system of particles will rotate around center of mass, else it will rotate around pivot

single force doesn't rotate body. couple( more than 2 force in opposite direction ) causes rotation => torque
T = r1xF1 + r2xF2
direction of r is from centre of rotation to force

The angular momentum of the particle is conserved, if the torque τ = r × F due to the
force F on it vanishes. thus the motion under a central force the angular momentum is always conserved.

gravitational force between two particles: GMm/r^2
gravitational intensity( acc due to gravity ), independent of other mass: GM/r^2

gravitational potential energy between two particles: -GMm/r
gravitational potential, independent of other particle: -GM/r

field is space around object where its influence can be experienced( eg in this case gravitational ), intensity of that field is experienced force by unit mass
potential is associated with location, it is amount of energy that can be provided by object at that location



The gravitational force on a particle inside a spherical shell is zero. However, (unlike a
metallic shell which shields electrical forces) the shell does not shield other bodies outside
it from exerting gravitational forces on a particle inside. Gravitational shielding is not
possible.

The property of a body, by virtue of which it tends to regain its original size and shape when the applied force is removed, is known as elasticity. 

pressure or stress both are F/A
relation between stress and strain for a given material can be found experimentally,
gnerally stress = k x strain

__questions__
why do protons have positive charge and e have negative charges
	or why similar looking protons repel each other and dissimilar proton and e attract 

e, p are form of energy, why did they combine to form atom, why not limited to one element atom, why so many different element atoms, is there some conscious biology( physics ) going on among subparticles( quarks.... )

if e are like earth around sun, who gave it circular motion... if e has wave behaviour, why doesn't it fall in nucleaus

where does gravity comes from,if sun is just made up of atoms/ions. is it like sum of mass of these these atoms bend the spacetime fabric to feel like gravity. does this mean gravity is not **fundamental force**

what is spacetime fabric made of

example of energy converting into mass, except blackhole

from dense blackhole with wave particle duality size, to big-bang how did wave energy converted into particles, which combined to form quarks, gluons and hence e, p, n to form atoms

yes number of elements in periodic table is constant because last element will have so much p,n that first shell e will have to run speed > c for being stable. Why did nature impose that speed limit. is it like we are trapped in some experiment boundry.

how does spring gets its pottential energy, how rearrangement of atoms gives rise to potential energy

electro-weak forces: unification of electro-magntetci and weak forces

how fast is bond making and breaking happens b/w p/e for two bodies sliding against each other. eg: ball falling in air, surface p/e create bond and break from p/e present in air and thus feel resistance. what will happen at speed ~ c


concept of centripetal force

hydraulic lift looks like against law of conservtion of energy
