information extraction and sentiment analysis
language translation and auto-option of next word

mostly solved: spam detection, part of speech tagging, named entity recognition
good progress: sentiment analysis, parsing, machine translation, information extraction
still really hard: question answering in general, paraphrase, summarization, dialog without human knowing

ambiguity is pervasive
	eg: fed raises interest rates

non standard english
segmentation issue
idioms
neologisms
tricky entity names

knowledge about language
knowledge about world knowledge

text processing:
	using regualar expression

false positive: mathcing patterns which should not match eg: matching they when trying the, we improve these thus increasing accuracy or precision
false negative: not matching which match
eg: not matching The when trying the, we solve these thus increasing coverage or recall

Every NLP task needs to:
1) segmenting / tokenizing words in running text
2) normalizing word formats
3) segmenting sentencces in running text

eg: I do uh.. main- mainly business data
uh: fragment
main filled pauses 
**lemma:**  same stem, part of speech, rough word sense 
eg: cat and cats = same lemma
**wordforms**: full inlected surface form
eg: cat and cats = different wordforms

**type**: an element of vocabulary
**token: **an instance of that type in running text

N = #tokens
V = vocabulary = set of types

church and gayle: |V| > O( N^1/2 )

eg:	
phone conversation 2.4 million tokens(N), 20K types(V)
**segmentation**
problems in english: 
don't
ph.d.
other-day, other day

problems in frech, german, chinese, japanesse => 2.4 chars per character

maximum matching word segmentation algo( greedy ):
suppose we use it for english
eg: thetabledownthere should be the table down there
but gives theta bled own there
it checks for longest matching word in dictionary

not good for english without spaces, works well for chinese

once we have done segmentation we need to normalize.
**normalization:** indexed terms and query terms must have same form.
eg: U.S.A and USA : always deleting periods
we reduce all letters to lower case letters but exception should be in mind like Fed vs fed, SAIL vs sail, US vs us

**Lemmatization**
reduce inflections or variant forms to base form or
finding correct dictionary headword form
am, are, is -> be
cars, car, car's -> car

**Morphology:** study of morpheme
**morpheme**: small meaniongfull units that make up words
	stems: core meaning bearing unit
	affixes: bits and pieces that adhere to stems

eg: stems has stem as stem and s as affix
	affixes has affix as stem and es as affix

**stemming: **chopping of affixes 
eg: automate, automatic, automation => automat
**porter algo**: most common english stemmer
step 1a: remove sses, ies, ss, s in order
step 1b: (*v*) ing, ed -> NULL
step 2: ational -> ate, izer -> ize
.
.
.
various rules

dealing with complex morphology is necessary. eg turkish
words has to be normalized and stemmed to get normal form.

**segmenting out sentence**
!,? unambiguous
. ambiguous like abbreviations Ph.D., Dr. , 12.23=> solve this using binary classifier 

use decision tree, probable words in begining of line, end of line
generally we use machine learning to build decision tree

minimum edit distance: for similarty for two strings
in sentence min edit distance of words can help.
in weighted min edit distance, we put cost for each operation.

computational biology:
needleman-wunsh algo
smith-waterman algo

**Language modeling:**
assign a prob to sentence
to measure good and bad in machine translation
eg: P(high winds tonight) > P(large winds tonight)
spell correction
eg: P(fifteen minutes from now  ) > P(fifteen minuets from now)
speech recognition
eg: P(I saw a van) > P(eyes own of an )
