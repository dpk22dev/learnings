we don't put css/js in akamai servers, we just point dns to akamai and configure akamai which server it should hit for content. it then caches the content and updates in the cluster.

ESI can be used to cache page across akamai

Resource records are the basic information element of the Domain Name System (DNS). They are distinguished by a type identification (A, MX, NS, etc.) and a DNS class (Internet, CHAOS, etc.). The records have a validity period (time-to-live) assigned to them, indicating when the information they hold must be refreshed from an authoritative name server.

http://ipremoval.sms.symantec.com/lookup/

 warmup: send mails incrementally, ip bounce logs and reputation is checked regularly, 

buy domain for ns-server also, put glue record for ns server on com servers
ns-server is organization specific not domain specific
use bind for ns

various records 
mysql -> SRV, give port, services, search
internal mailing

imp: A, CNAME, MX, TXT, SRV, NS, SOA, PTR or RDNS

you purchased static IP, configured machine with this IP. Now you can run any service on this machine. world can reach you, access your service. but nobody remembers IP. you need domain. you checked if domain exists or not. if not purchased domain( monthly/yearly subscription etc... ).

You need NS server( should be more than one... ) that can reply for queries of domains  in an organization. 

TXT, ZONE file for root zone server, com servers

Each domain has at least one authoritative DNS server that publishes information about that domain and the name servers of any domains subordinate to it

An authoritative name server can either be a master server or a slave server. A master server is a server that stores the original (master) copies of all zone records.

man resolvconf
man dnsmasq

Resolvconf thus sets itself up as the intermediary between programs that supply nameserver information and applications that use that information.
Normally  the  resolvconf  program  is  run only by network interface configuration programs such as pppd(8) (for ppp inter‚Äê
       faces); by DHCP clients such as dhclient(8); by ifup(8) and ifdown; and by DNS caches such as dnsmasq(8) (for  the  loopback
       interface).  These programs obtain nameserver information from some source and push it to resolvconf.
