storm is computation system, not framework like hadoop

spout abstraction makes easier to integrate with queueing and database systems
There are just three abstractions in Storm: spouts, bolts, and topologies.

storm deamons: nimbus( thrift service: can accept form multiple languages), supervisors along with zookeeper

similar to hadoop map-reduce, storm runs topologies
mapreduce jobs is finished, but topology keeps on running forever
