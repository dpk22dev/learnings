capped collection : good for logs, caching
You cannot delete documents from a capped collection. To remove all documents from a collection, use the drop() method to drop the collection and recreate the capped collection. No sharding. 

 maximum BSON document size is 16 megabytes.

For the MMAPv1 storage engine, intervening write operations on a document may result in a cursor that returns a document more than once if that document has changed.

query steps:
collection, query-criteria, projection, cursor-modifier

aggregation steps: 
match stage, group stage

 A collection can only have one text search index, but that index can cover multiple fields.

******** questions *****
diff b/w json and bson, why not store simply as json string
why different data-types
