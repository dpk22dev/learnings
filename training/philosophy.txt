premise + premise + premise => conclusion

validity != truth

tools used for logic:
deduction: all true premises lead to true conclusion
induction: future is predicted based on past experiences, conclusion might not be true( outliers )
abduction: eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable must be true. info in hand is used to predict future.

plato: nature of reality: we are prisoners of cave who see merely shadow of higher dimensional reality

rene: decartesian skepticism
disbelief everything and then keep only true beliefs. but our senses fail us everytime
local doubt: step out and see if its true eg dream
global doubt: can't step out of it. eg: if world was created just 5 min ago with god putting everything in it. can't disapprove it.
foundational belief: i think, therefore i am.
