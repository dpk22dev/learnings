git
===
Created Friday 18 July 2014

An untracked file is a file that exists in the working tree of a git repository but isn't listed in the index. 

An unstaged is a file that is listed in the index, but the contents of the file in the working tree are different to the contents listed in the index - the sha1 hash of the file in the working tree is different to the sha1 hash for that the same file in the list maintained by the index, usually because the file has been edited since the index was last updated by a checkout, reset or add command.

In both cases, running git add on the file will cause the file to be both staged and tracked and if the index is the committed in that state then the tree referenced by the new commit will contain a file with the same sha1 hash as the previously staged file

whatever file you create are shown in untracked by git, 
use git add to make it tracked, whatever changes you make in tracked files are shown as modified
when you git commit, objects are created index are created for those files 

if you want to not see untracked files put their names in gitignore

for git autocompletion use: source /etc/bash_completion.d/git

changes made to git are visible automatically to netbeans:

git pull origin master: means there is remote named origin, local copy of that master is in origin/master and we have our master branch
we can merge using git merge

HEAD is, normally, a symbolic reference to [the tip of] a branch when we checkout branch. we can point head to another commit( in detached HEAD state ) and create new branch from there.

try to avoid merge, run git rebase before pushing code, even on pull git by default merges code with branch( say master ). use rebase strategy on pull instead of merge
git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always

we can use git reflog to view brief history what we did recently, although viewing it with git lg is more better

diff b/w checkout and reset
checkout moves HEAD to some commit, while reset moves current branch to some commit

always make logical commits so that you can revert them if needed later

diff b/w reset and revert
reset: undo working changes and return to particular commit, commits are removed so shouldn't be done on public branches
revert: working dir should be clean before doing it, used for public commits


git checkout -b newBranch existBranch
create newBranch from existBranch

git checkout bug 
to change to bug branch

git add file
add file to current branch

git status
to show status of current files

git commit -m "first comment"
commit the changes to local

git push
it will push all the branches from local to remote

git push origin bug
push bug branch to remote

git pull 
it will pull all branches from remote to local

git pull origin Branch
it will pull Branch from remote to local

git cherry -v master
changes of current branch only; use origin/master if branch was made off origin/master rather than master

git log master..
changes if current branch only; use origin/master if branch was made off origin/master rather than master

git checkout 0d1d7fc32
to checkout prevous logged commit

git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32
this will destroy local modifications; use git stash before it if you want to keep current changes

git show-branch
to see branches and their commits 

git show --pretty="format:" --name-only bd61ad98
to show the list of files in commit with id bd61ad98.

or use:
git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r bd61ad98

git branch -a
shows all local and remote branches

git branch -v
shows head of each local branch

git remote -v
show fetch and push origins

git fetch remote branch
git fetch <remote> <rbranch>:<lbranch> 
git checkout <lbranch>

adding upstream to branch
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin

script to see git tree:
git config --global alias.lg "log --graph --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(bold white)— %an%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)' --abbrev-commit --date=relative --all"

now use 
git lg to show tree
git lg shows commits acc to time, branches, head are just pointers to those commits

to get file from other branch 
git checkout branchX file2

git pull does a git fetch followed by a git merge. so git fetch is always safe.

git merging selective files:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/449541/how-do-you-merge-selective-files-with-git-merge

adding files to git:
$ git add .   # add to index only files created/modified and not those deleted
$ git add -u  # add to index only files deleted/modified and not those created
$ git add -A  # do both operation at once, add to index all files

diff b/w two branches
git diff branch_1..branch_2

diff b/w two branches with filenames only
git diff --name-status branch1..branch2

annotated tag in git
git tag -a v1.4 -m 'my version 1.4'

search for tags
git tag -l 'v3.2.7*'

delete branch on origin
 git push --delete origin branch_name

adding remote 
git remote add origin https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY

git merge direction
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2351108/git-merge-two-branches-what-direction

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1241720/git-cherry-pick-vs-merge-workflow

merge rules:
fast forward merge: move back branch to top branch
2 way: if on b1, git merge b2: creates new commit, moves b1 to it


rules for rebasing b1 on to b2
git pull both the branches involved
git checkout b1
git rebase b2 // it will cut b1 and put it on b2
git checkout b1
git merge b2 // it will move b2 till b1

showing removing untracked files with -n switch
git clean -fdn
remove them using git clean -fd

renaming a branch:
git branch -m old_branch_name new_branch_name

get history of file:
 git log  -p path/to/file

diff of particular file betwwen particular commits
 git diff 8dd6fdc 7fb5ca9 -- lib/timelineService.js

**guidelines**

TL;DR

'''
    The highest right(s) a user can obtain is `Developer`
    A user can have not more than 5 project(s) in his local workspace.
    To obtain permission to a repository approval of the respective team manager is required
    We shall follow Forking Workflow in case of Repositories under Group(s) like NaukriLibs, NaukriGulfLibs, FirstNaukriLibs, etc.
'''


Group(s)

'''
    The highest right(s) a user can obtain in any group is `Developer`
    `Owner` rights to a group lies only with TechOps Team
    Any new group would be created only after proper discussion
'''

Repositories / Project(s)

'''
    The highest right(s) a user can obtain in any group is `Developer`
    `Owner` rights to a repository lies only with TechOps Team
    Addition of a user to any of the existing project shall be upon approval by respective project team manager(s)
    Any new repository  / project would be created only after proper discussion
'''

User(s)

'''
    A user can have a maximum of 5 project(s) in his local workspace, for additional projects to be added he must remove earlier one and create a new one.
    Each user must use LDAP / Exchange Credentials to login to Gitlab
'''




**Semantic Versioning** 

Q: What is the tags / versions going to look like?
   
'''
     vX.Y.Z-beta1, vX.Y.Z-beta2....vX.Y.Z-rc1, vX.Y.Z-rc2...,vX.Y.Z
'''

Q: What does X, Y, Z stands for?
   
'''
     X - Major Version (Usually in case of revamp or major functionality additions)
     Y - Minor Version (Regular feature addition(s) - excluding bugfixes / enhancements)
     Z - Bugfixes / Enhancements
'''

Q: When do I decide version for a release?

'''
    The version for a release can be decided at the time of first iteration and it stays fixed till the release.
    The version for a release can also be decided at the time of QA Drop for first iteration and again it stays fixed till the final release
'''

Q: Does `Z` changes with every QA Drop?
    
'''
     No. Since the version is for the software / application / release it stays same through out the cycle. As mentioned above all consecutive QA Drops are suffixed with beta1, beta2, beta3, etc. & Staging / Pre-release drops with rc1, rc2, rc3, etc. respectively
'''

Q: When & Where do I create a stable version for a release i.e. vX.Y.Z?
   
'''
    The final version is created on Master branch upon successfull merge after the release.
'''

Q: What if my release gets postponed and goes live in future?
    
'''
     A new version will be created whenever it goes live keeping the sequence of version intact. It(s) perfectly fine to skip release number(s) between development. For example we can have a release version 1.4.12 going before 1.4.10. But when 1.4.10 becomes ready, it will be re-versioned as 1.4.13 during QA / Pre-releases / Release drop(s).

**Git aliases** 
1)
	i)  git config --global alias.lg "log --graph --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(bold white)— %an%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)' --abbrev-commit --date=relative --all"
	ii) git lg
    
2) Use rebase instead of merge
	git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
    
3) Cache uname/password until timeout
	git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=36000'

**Git Migration Process** 
1. Revoke Write Access to existing Subversion repository**
2. Porting of Code (including svn:externals) to Git (i.e. Latest Stable Code)*
3. Changing of Capistrano to deploy code from Git repository**
4. Setup of development environment to point to Git repository***

* Done using script(s)
** Tasks to be performed by TechOps Team
