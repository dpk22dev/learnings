strategy:
set financial goals

acc to pranjal:
debt instruments/funds are bad for investments giving 8% return; in bad days companies can default. instead put money in big banks, govt can help in case of failures
mid cap funds are 150 companies; FM is restricted to buy among those only
small cap: 20%  in small cap if money is surplus and risk appetite is good
sector fund: stay away from sectorial funds, eg pharma is hyped, as people are not consuming in corona period
index fund, balanced fund: stay away
good fund: any rolling 5yrs period return should be good, expense ratio should be good

check funds : if they have too much investment in banking funds; in crisis time they can fall, they have become semi secotrial fund

a large cap fund, two multi cap funds and two small cap funds.
below 30: 
above 40: 50% equity , 50%balanced

based on mf taxation for stcg and ltcg
its good for me in equity based: 
its good for mao in non-equity based

for long term invest in growth schemes not in divident ones

is there fee for stopping sip for few months
	it can be paused, no fee
can we inc/dec sip in any month
	inc/dec is not allowed, but you can pause, top up sip. some ask for restarting new sip
is just performance over last few years good enough for analysing mf, what else should we see
taxes on debt mutual funds, are liquid and short term also taxable
liquid, short term debt funds vs saving account
	looks like liquid fund are good for short term parking rather than in saving accound, ultra short term, short term are bad, income funds look good	
whose rating is better: morning star, crisil, value research
	doen't matter. choose according to your risk appetite. choose fund who has consistent rating across them.
when switching do people take out money from fund scheme or stop investing and park money there

does aum size matter
