security attacks: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page

content security policy: headers tell browser allowed list of domains for scripts=> avoid XSS
same origin policy: script from one domain/host/port can access DOM of same domain/host/port

how jsonp works

a.com										b.com

( ajax wants to access b.com )

then b.com should set 

**authentication and authorization**

authentication: 
multi factor authentication: Oauth, FIDO alliance
internal only authentication: Kerberos, Novell Netware
federated
SSO

authorization: 
role based access control ( RBAC )
atribute based access control ( ABAC )

RBAC can also be configured to implement Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC) policies.

person goes from UK to US.
In this example the UK is the Identity Provider (also known as the Asserting Party) and the US is the Service Provider (also known as the Relying Party).

PEP
PDP

XACML: 

**challenge response authentication CRAM-MD5**
instead of sending username/password to server. client sends username, server as it knows password( or hash of password ) it creates say number and asks client to increment it. only client using password( or hash of password ) decrypts number, increaments number and sends response.
password doesn't needs to be sent over network. for non-repudiation, avoid maninmiddle attack server may send nonce.

SASL( simple authentication and security layer):  is a framework for authentication and data security in Internet protocols. It decouples authentication mechanisms from application protocols. it allows protocols to choose from various mechanisms wchich implement a series of challenges and responses.
https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/isms/current/msg00063.html
there are various protocols which use SASL: eg: POP, IMAP, XMPP, LDAP etc...
kerberos:

LDAP:
data is stored in directory using X.500 format( key value pair ). this data can be accessed using LDAP.
LDAP uses SAML which might use kerberos mechanism for authentication.

certificate used in ssl comm:
X.509 certificate is written using ASN.1 notations

list: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjVYl1Ts6XI&index=53&list=PLBf0hzazHTGOEuhPQSnq-Ej8jRyXxfYvl
nmap or zenmap for port scanning
	netdiscover does the same
for testing sql-injection use site at: http://www.dvwa.co.uk/
sqlmap -u "url with query param"
proxychains for proxying connection
disable script using extension while browsing
for downloadin site: wget -mk https://www.url.com
stegosuite: for embedding text in image 
lazy script for managing cmd tools: https://github.com/arismelachroinos/lscript	
use openvpn from eg: vpnbook
beelogger: tool to create keylogger exe https://github.com/4w4k3/BeeLogger
metasploitable - vulnerable os for security lab testing
for expoloits of various servers: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework
	check for dns leaks before this
	https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/modules-and-locations/( good )
	use command msfconsole/ metasploit-gui / 
	armitage ( easy to use gui ): find attacks, exploit, see what underlying is happening
	use metasploitable2 linux in vm which contains various vulnerabilities for learning
		on this vm for giving router-ips rather than 10. series ip, under 
	metasploit on android: phone needs to be rooted, termux with busybox needs to be installed
shodan: iot search engine; find possible vulnerable devices on internet
linux explorer: linux forensics like processes, files etc
saint: java based spyware for keylogging, webcam etc for windows, sends data to gmail account
quasarRAT: windows based remote administration tool
arpspoof: MITM at layer 2, dsniff/wireshark for collecting data
ettercap: same as arpspoof but with gui
wpscan: for wordpress hacking: enumeration and backdoor entry is possible
weevely: php backdoor: it generates php script to be replaced on server; it provides shell on remote machine
john-the-ripper: password cracking; wordlist can be taken from [[/usr/share/wordlist]]
crunch: min to max lenght of specified characters list can be generated to be feed into crackers
chkrootkit: check for rootkit installed in machine
beef: hook client browser by embedding hook.js; hacker can select from list of vulnerabilities and exploit same as metasploit
medusa: multithreaded password cracker
veil-evasion: make spywares undetectable from antiviruses
pentest-box: pentest for windows natively
zanti : pentest for android( not much good )

wiki for links to other sites: http://zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

use good dns provider who likely doesn't track by changing resolv.conf settings, run tor, disable scripts on browser on live system like parrot os
use torbox/bitmessage or other tor service for mail
scan for ports and services, search for eg: vsftpd 2.3.4 exploits

**questions:**
why so many authentication protocols, what is use of each
how proxies under anonsurf/tor work; can they store my info
diff b/w vpn and proxy chains
